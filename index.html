            <p>
              I am a Southern California Native being born and Raised in Redlands.  I have always loved Utah and decided to live here after I finished Automotive school.
              I have been an automotive technician for Mercedes Benz for 3 years and have decided it is time to move on in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey with Web Development is one of passion and determination.  As a child watching Tron and other tech centered films I was amazed by what was possible.  i knew at that time that i wanted to learn the skills to do anything with a computer.
              I have worked hard to keep myself up-to-date with the latest in html, css, and javascript development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, gaming, and managing my personal financial portfolio.
